# Testing

To test kittydar, run:

```
node test.js
```

This will run `kittydar.detectCats()` on several images. The number of cats missed is reported, as well as the number of false positives.

## Test Images

The test images are located in the `TEST` directory. Many of them are from @maxogden's [maxogden/cats](http://github.com/maxogden/cats) under BSD license.
